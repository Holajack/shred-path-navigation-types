  spot_types text[] not null,
  created_by uuid references public.profiles(id) not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

#### Photos Table
```sql

## Known Issues
- TypeScript linting errors for some dependencies
- Need to implement proper form validation
- Need to add error handling for auth flows
- Need to implement proper error handling for spot operations
- Need to add loading states for map markers
- Need to add photo upload capability to AddSpotScreen
- Need to implement form validation in AddSpotScreen
- Need to implement photo gallery in SpotDetailsScreen
- Need to implement edit functionality in SpotDetailsScreen
- Need to implement actual image upload in EditProfileScreen
- Need to add proper error handling for profile updates

## Performance Considerations
- Implement spot clustering for dense areas
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Implement offline support
- Use lazy loading for map markers

## Security Measures
- Supabase RLS policies
- Input validation
- Image upload restrictions
- API rate limiting
